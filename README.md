# daily-ai-detection README

`daily-ai-detection` is a plugin designed to test and improve the your ability to recognize AI-generated artworks. The plugin automatically displays a page with four artworks when VS Code is first launched each day. Among the four images, 0~4 images are AI-generated, and you needs to select all of the AI-generated images. After confirming your choice, the plugin shows the results:

- The correctly selected image is highlighted with a green border.

- The incorrectly selected image is highlighted with a red border.

- The unselected AI-generated image is highlighted with a yellow border.

Apart from the automatic pop-up on the first launch of VS Code each day, users can manually open the test page by using the `Ctrl+Shift+P` shortcut and entering the `command AI Artworks` Detection.

**Enjoy!**
